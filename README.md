## Introduction


This guide will help you install GitHub, an important tool for managing and working on software projects with others. GitHub is like a website where developers can store and organize their code. It's really helpful for teamwork and keeping track of changes made to the code.


## Purpose

GitHub is a platform for hosting code that allows for version control and collaboration. It allows you and others to collaborate on projects from anywhere. This lesson will teach you the fundamentals of GitHub, such as repositories, branches, commits, and pull requests




## Features






|  **Sr No** | **Feature**                   | Description                                                                                                                           |
|---|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1. | **Smooth project management** | GitHub provides a collaborative space for project managers and developers to coordinate, track, and update their work efficiently. Projects progress smoothly, ensuring timeliness and transparency. |
| 2. | **Safe packages**              | GitHub allows you to publish packages privately or publicly, facilitating easy sharing within teams or with the open-source community. Packages can be downloaded directly from GitHub for use or reuse. |
| 3. | **Improved code writing**      | Team members can review, develop, and propose new code on GitHub. Discussions on implementation and proposals can occur before making changes to the source code. |
| 4. | **Unique code safety**         | GitHub offers dedicated tools for identifying and analyzing vulnerabilities in code, enhancing security across the software supply chain. Teams can collaborate to ensure code safety comprehensively. |
| 5. | **Effective team management**  | GitHub promotes organizational alignment within teams, aided by moderation tools like Issue and Pull Request Locking, which help maintain focus on code-related tasks. |
| 6. | **Easy code hosting**          | GitHub simplifies code hosting by centralizing code and documentation in one location. Its vast repository base offers various tools to facilitate code hosting and release processes effectively. |
| 7. | **Branching and Merging**      | GitHub supports branching, enabling developers to work on isolated features or bug fixes in separate branches. Changes made in these branches can be merged back into the main codebase when ready. |
| 8. | **Pull Requests**              | Pull Requests (PRs) are a mechanism for proposing changes to a project. Developers can submit PRs to suggest changes made in their branches, allowing others to review the code before it's merged. |
| 9. | **Issue Tracking**             | GitHub includes an issue tracking system that allows users to report and discuss bugs, request new features, and manage project-related tasks. It provides a centralized way to organize and prioritize work. |
| 10. | **Documentation**             | GitHub provides a space for project documentation. Developers can include README files and other documentation to explain the purpose, usage, and contribution guidelines for their projects. |
